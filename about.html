        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>I am a first-year student at Cypress College with a lifelong passion for technology.
           From a young age, I was captivated by how technology works, specifically its ability to replicate
           real life or bring entirely new ideas to existence. This curiosity led me to explore web and game 
           development, where I can use my creativity and imagination to build amazing applications.

           I love to work on websites and developing video games because there is always room for improvement
           and innovation. Whether it's improving a feature, changing functionality, or adding simple mechanics,
           I enjoy the challenge of continuous learning. Technology gives me the freedom to imagine, create, and
           bring ideas to life.
